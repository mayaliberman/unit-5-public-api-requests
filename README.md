# Employee Directory Using API

In this project, I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. I created a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
